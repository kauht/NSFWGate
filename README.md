  <b>BetterDiscord and Vencord recently removed their NSFWGate plugins, leaving users without access to age-restricted content on Discord. This plugin restores access to age-gated content by removing Discord's age verification gate.</b><br>

### You can find it [here](https://github.com/kauht/venkord)
